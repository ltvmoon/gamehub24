```

**Key Concepts:**
- 🎮 **Client-Authoritative**: Game logic runs on the client (host)
- 🔄 **Pure Relay Server**: Server only relays events, no game validation
- 👑 **Host as Authority**: Room creator manages game state
- 👥 **Guest Receives State**: Guests sync state from host

## 📦 Deployment

### Frontend (Cloudflare Pages / Vercel / Netlify)

### Backend (Railway / Render / Fly.io)
```bash
cd server
npm run build
npm start
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```env
PORT=3001
